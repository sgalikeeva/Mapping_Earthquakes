# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
Using Leaflet and Mapbox, wrote a code to show earthquake data for the last 7 days, major earthquakes and tectonic plates. Each type of data is a different layer group on the map that can be toggled through. There are 3 options for the map view - street, satellite and light. Street view is the default that loads automatically.
